# 📘 Cursor Coding Assistant Rules for CrewAI (Hypno Chatbot)

## 🔍 Project Context
This project uses [CrewAI](mdc:https:/github.com/joaomdmoura/crewai), an open-source Python framework for orchestrating multi-agent autonomous workflows.

We're building a hypnotherapy chatbot using CrewAI agents and tasks, structured as YAML files and Python modules.

## 🧠 When You're Not Sure About Something...

If you're unsure how a class, method, or tool works:

### 🔗 Use These Sources of Truth:
- ✅ [CrewAI GitHub Repository (source code)](mdc:https:/github.com/joaomdmoura/crewai)
- ✅ [CrewAI Official Docs](mdc:https:/docs.crewai.com)

These are always more reliable than hallucinating logic or assumptions. Always double-check the GitHub codebase, especially for:

- `Agent`, `Task`, `Crew`, `Process` classes
- YAML configuration expectations
- Available built-in tools (`crewai_tools`)
- CLI features like `crewai create <project>`

---

## 🛠️ Tools You Can Expect

This project may include:
- Custom `@tool` decorators from `crewai_tools`
- External tools like RAG (e.g., `LangChain` retrievers)
- FastAPI for serving the chatbot backend

Avoid assuming tool behavior — instead, trace the decorators or refer to LangChain/LlamaIndex docs when integrating.

---

## 📝 YAML Tip

YAML config files in `src/hypnobot/config/agents.yaml` and `tasks.yaml` follow this pattern:

```yaml
agent_name:
  role: >
    Role of the agent
  goal: >
    What they're trying to achieve
  backstory: >
    Detailed context for better prompts
```

Make sure to format these cleanly. The agents/tasks are imported via Python and injected into the Crew.

## 💬 Suggested Prompts for You to Use

```
"Show me the full class definition of Agent from the CrewAI GitHub."
"Based on the official docs, how is a tool expected to behave?"
"Validate this agents.yaml file using the schema from CrewAI."
```

## 🤖 Model Guidance

This project uses LLMs via LangChain. You can plug in:

- OpenAI
- Gemini (via Google)
- DeepSeek
- Claude
- Local models via Ollama

Don't hardcode OpenAI unless needed — costs matter.
