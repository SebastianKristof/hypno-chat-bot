# CrewAI Best Practices for Hypnotherapy Chatbot

This document outlines the recommended best practices for implementing a multi-agent chatbot using CrewAI, specifically for the hypnotherapy domain.

## Core Architecture Principles

### 1. Agent Specialization

Each agent in the system should have a clearly defined role with specialized capabilities:

- **Client-Facing Agent**: Focused on user interaction, information delivery, and maintaining a supportive tone
- **QA/Safety Agent**: Dedicated to content review, safety monitoring, and intervention when needed

This separation of concerns ensures each agent can excel at its primary function without compromising performance.

### 2. Process-Driven Workflows

Use CrewAI's `Process` class to define explicit agent interaction flows:

```python
from crewai import Agent, Task, Process, Crew

hypno_process = Process(
    name="HypnotherapyChatProcess",
    description="Process user queries with safety monitoring",
    tasks=[respond_task, review_task],
    agents=[client_agent, qa_agent],
    flow={
        respond_task: [review_task],  # Review follows response
        review_task: []               # End of process
    }
)
```

This ensures consistent execution paths and reliable agent collaboration.

### 3. Hierarchical Task Decomposition

Break complex interactions into smaller, more manageable tasks:

1. **Query Understanding**: Analyze user intent and extract key information
2. **Knowledge Retrieval**: Find relevant hypnotherapy information
3. **Response Generation**: Formulate helpful, accurate responses
4. **Safety Review**: Evaluate content for safety concerns
5. **Intervention Application**: Apply safety protocols when needed

This approach improves agent performance by allowing focused attention on specific aspects of the conversation.

## Tool Implementation Best Practices

### 1. Modular Tool Design

Create tools with single responsibilities and clear interfaces:

```python
from crewai.tools import BaseTool

class HypnotherapyKnowledgeTool(BaseTool):
    name: str = "HypnotherapyKnowledgeTool"
    description: str = "Retrieves information about hypnotherapy methods and practices"
    
    def _run(self, query: str) -> str:
        # Implementation to retrieve information
        return formatted_result
```

### 2. Tool Documentation

Provide comprehensive descriptions and examples for each tool:

```python
class SafetyEvaluationTool(BaseTool):
    name: str = "SafetyEvaluationTool"
    description: str = """
    Evaluates content for safety concerns related to hypnotherapy discussions.
    Input should be a message to evaluate.
    Output will be a safety analysis with level (0-4) and recommendations.
    Example: "Will hypnotherapy cure my depression?" -> Safety level 2, medical claim
    """
```

### 3. Error Handling

Implement robust error handling in all tools:

```python
def _run(self, query: str) -> str:
    try:
        # Normal tool execution
        return result
    except Exception as e:
        # Log the error
        logger.error(f"Tool execution failed: {str(e)}")
        # Return a graceful failure message
        return f"I encountered an issue while retrieving information: {str(e)}"
```

## Agent Configuration Best Practices

### 1. Clear Role Definitions

Define explicit roles, goals, and backstories for each agent:

```yaml
# agents.yaml
client_agent:
  role: "Hypnotherapy Guide"
  goal: "Provide accurate, supportive information about hypnotherapy while ensuring user comfort and understanding"
  backstory: "You are an experienced guide helping people understand hypnotherapy and its benefits. You have years of experience explaining these concepts to newcomers in a clear, accessible way."
```

### 2. Optimized System Prompts

Keep system prompts focused on specific agent responsibilities:

- Include clear guidelines on tone, boundaries, and information accuracy
- Provide specific instructions for handling common scenarios
- Define explicit limitations and escalation paths

### 3. Few-Shot Examples

Include diverse examples covering common interaction patterns:

```
USER: What exactly is hypnotherapy and how does it work?

ASSISTANT: Hypnotherapy is a therapeutic approach that uses guided relaxation, focused attention, and suggestion to help achieve a heightened state of awareness, sometimes called a trance.

In this naturally occurring state, you remain in control but are more open to positive suggestions and exploring thoughts or feelings that might be less accessible during your normal waking state.

It works by accessing your subconscious mind, where many of our habitual patterns, behaviors, and responses are stored. By communicating directly with this part of the mind, hypnotherapy can help facilitate positive changes.

```

## Inter-Agent Communication

### 1. Standardized Message Format

Use consistent data structures for agent communication:

```json
{
  "user_message": "Original user input text",
  "client_agent_response": "Proposed response from client agent",
  "qa_analysis": {
    "safety_level": 0-4,
    "triggers": ["trigger1", "trigger2"],
    "intervention_type": "none|adjust|redirect|block|escalate",
    "reasoning": "Explanation of analysis and decision"
  },
  "final_response": "Approved or modified response to be sent to user"
}
```

### 2. Context Preservation

Maintain conversation context between agent interactions:

```python
def preserve_context(crew_state, task_output):
    # Update conversation history
    crew_state.conversation_history.append({
        "task": task.name,
        "output": task_output,
        "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat()
    })
    return crew_state
```

### 3. Graceful Degradation

Implement fallback mechanisms for communication failures:

```python
try:
    qa_result = await qa_agent.execute_task(review_task)
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"QA agent failed: {str(e)}")
    # Use a safe default response when QA fails
    qa_result = {
        "safety_level": 2,  # Cautious middle ground
        "intervention_type": "adjust",
        "final_response": add_safety_disclaimer(client_response)
    }
```

## Testing and Evaluation

### 1. Comprehensive Test Suites

Implement tests at multiple levels:

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual agents and tools
- **Integration Tests**: Test agent interactions
- **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete conversation flows
- **Safety Tests**: Test specific safety scenarios

### 2. Evaluation Metrics

Track key performance indicators:

- Response accuracy and relevance
- Safety intervention precision and recall
- User satisfaction metrics
- Conversation completion rates

### 3. Human Feedback Loop

Establish processes for human review and feedback:

- Regular review of conversation logs
- Systematic analysis of safety interventions
- Continuous prompt and tool refinement

## Knowledge Management

### 1. Structured Knowledge Organization

Organize hypnotherapy knowledge into logical categories:

- Methods and techniques
- Session preparation and expectations
- Common concerns and misconceptions
- Safety information and limitations

### 2. Consistent Metadata Schema

Apply consistent metadata to all knowledge entries:

```json
{
  "id": "technique_progressive_relaxation",
  "category": "technique",
  "title": "Progressive Relaxation",
  "content": "Progressive relaxation is a technique where...",
  "keywords": ["relaxation", "stress", "anxiety", "beginner"],
  "related_entries": ["technique_visualization", "session_preparation"]
}
```

### 3. Content Versioning

Implement proper versioning for knowledge content:

- Track content changes with version history
- Date-stamp all content updates
- Maintain an audit trail of content modifications

## Continuous Improvement

### 1. Regular Performance Analysis

Schedule regular system evaluation:

- Weekly analysis of conversation logs
- Monthly review of safety interventions
- Quarterly evaluation of overall system performance

### 2. Iterative Enhancement

Establish an iterative improvement process:

1. Collect performance data and user feedback
2. Identify areas for improvement
3. Implement targeted enhancements
4. Test changes against historical data
5. Deploy and monitor improvements

### 3. Knowledge Expansion

Continuously expand the knowledge base:

- Add new hypnotherapy information as it becomes available
- Update content based on user questions
- Refine responses to common queries

By following these best practices, your hypnotherapy chatbot will benefit from CrewAI's full capabilities while maintaining high standards for user experience, safety, and information quality.
