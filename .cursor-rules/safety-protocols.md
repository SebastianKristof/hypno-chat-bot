# Safety Protocols & QA Guidelines: Hypnotherapy Multi-Agent Chatbot

This document outlines the safety protocols, content guidelines, and quality assurance processes for the hypnotherapy multi-agent chatbot system.

## Core Safety Principles

1. **Do No Harm**: The chatbot must never provide responses that could potentially harm users or encourage harmful behaviors.
2. **Scope Awareness**: The chatbot must clearly recognize and communicate the boundaries of its capabilities and the scope of hypnotherapy.
3. **Privacy Protection**: User data and conversations must be handled with appropriate privacy and security measures.
4. **Professional Standards**: All information provided must align with accepted professional standards of hypnotherapy practice.
5. **Crisis Recognition**: The system must recognize potential crisis situations and provide appropriate escalation paths.

## Content Classification Framework

### Safe Content (Permit)
- General information about hypnotherapy methods and techniques
- Session planning and preparation guidance
- Relaxation techniques and self-help strategies
- FAQ responses about hypnotherapy process
- General wellness and stress-management information

### Borderline Content (Review)
- Discussion of specific psychological conditions
- Requests for personalized therapeutic advice
- Complex questions about hypnotherapy effectiveness
- Requests for specific techniques to address particular issues
- Discussions of medication or other treatments

### Prohibited Content (Block)
- Medical diagnosis or treatment recommendations
- Crisis or emergency mental health support
- Legal or financial advice
- Sexual or inappropriate content
- Content that could trigger or worsen mental health conditions
- Claims of cures or guaranteed outcomes
- Medication advice or recommendations

## QA Agent Intervention Protocols

### Monitoring Process
1. **Real-time Scanning**: All user inputs are analyzed by the QA agent before client agent responds
2. **Content Classification**: Messages are classified based on safety thresholds
3. **Semantic Analysis**: Beyond keywords, context and intent are evaluated
4. **Response Validation**: Proposed responses from client agent are reviewed before delivery

### Intervention Levels

#### Level 1: Minor Adjustment
- **Trigger**: Slight deviation from best practices or minor clarification needed
- **Action**: Modify client agent response to include disclaimers or clearer boundaries
- **Example**: "While hypnotherapy can be helpful for managing stress, I should clarify that it's a complementary approach, not a replacement for medical treatment."

#### Level 2: Redirect
- **Trigger**: Questions or requests outside the chatbot's scope but not harmful
- **Action**: Provide alternative response that acknowledges limitation and redirects
- **Example**: "That's beyond what I can help with as a hypnotherapy assistant. Instead, I can tell you about how hypnotherapy sessions are structured."

#### Level 3: Block & Educate
- **Trigger**: Requests for inappropriate content or potentially harmful advice
- **Action**: Block original response, provide educational alternative
- **Example**: "I can't provide specific techniques for treating clinical depression as hypnotherapy is a complementary approach. It's important to work with qualified mental health professionals for such conditions."

#### Level 4: Escalate
- **Trigger**: Crisis indicators or serious mental health concerns
- **Action**: Provide crisis resources and escalation options
- **Example**: "I notice you've mentioned thoughts of self-harm. This chatbot isn't equipped to provide crisis support. Please contact a mental health professional immediately or call the crisis helpline at [CRISIS_NUMBER]."

## Safety Rule Categories

### 1. Crisis Detection Rules
- Keywords related to self-harm, suicide, or acute distress
- Expressions of hopelessness or desperation
- Statements indicating imminent danger to self or others

### 2. Scope Limitation Rules
- Requests for medical diagnosis or treatment
- Questions seeking clinical mental health treatment
- Requests for hypnosis to treat serious mental health conditions

### 3. Ethical Practice Rules
- Requests for guarantees or promises of outcomes
- Attempts to use hypnotherapy for controlling others
- Content related to past life regression or memory recovery

### 4. Content Appropriateness Rules
- Sexually explicit content
- Requests for age regression for non-therapeutic purposes
- Manipulation or coercion attempts

## Implementation of Safety Systems

### Rule Configuration
```yaml
# Example rule definition
rule_id: medical_advice
category: scope_limitation
description: "Prevents the system from providing medical advice"
triggers:
  keywords:
    - "diagnose"
    - "prescription"
    - "cure my"
  patterns:
    - "(?i)\\b(can|could|will|would)\\s+(hypnotherapy|hypnosis|it)\\s+(cure|treat|heal)\\b"
  semantic_categories:
    - "medical_treatment_request"
thresholds:
  confidence_min: 0.6
  severity_level: "medium"
actions:
  action_type: "redirect"
  response_template: "I understand you're asking about treating {condition} with hypnotherapy. While hypnotherapy can be a complementary approach for some conditions, I'm not qualified to provide medical advice. Hypnotherapy works best alongside traditional medical treatments under the guidance of healthcare professionals."
```

### Intervention Decision Tree

```
1. Analyze message content
   ↓
2. Check against keyword triggers
   ↓
3. If triggered → Classify severity
   ↓
4. Score ≥ 0.8 → Level 4 (Escalate)
   Score 0.6-0.8 → Level 3 (Block)
   Score 0.4-0.6 → Level 2 (Redirect)
   Score 0.2-0.4 → Level 1 (Adjust)
   Score < 0.2 → Allow
   ↓
5. Apply appropriate intervention
   ↓
6. Log intervention for review
```

## Quality Assurance Processes

### Continuous Monitoring
- Review of flagged conversations by human QA team
- Regular sampling of non-flagged conversations
- Analysis of user feedback and satisfaction metrics

### Agent Performance Metrics
- Safety rule trigger accuracy
- False positive/negative rates
- Intervention appropriateness
- User satisfaction post-intervention

### Improvement Cycle
1. **Collect Data**: Log all interventions and user interactions
2. **Analyze Patterns**: Identify common triggers and edge cases
3. **Refine Rules**: Update safety rules based on analysis
4. **Test Updates**: Validate improvements with historical data
5. **Deploy**: Roll out updated rules with monitoring

## Human-in-the-Loop Processes

### Escalation Paths
1. **Immediate Risk**: Direct to crisis resources and emergency services
2. **Clinical Needs**: Referral to appropriate mental health professionals
3. **Complex Queries**: Flag for human hypnotherapist review
4. **Edge Cases**: Route to human QA team for evaluation

### Human QA Review Process
- Regular audit of random conversation samples
- Focused review of all Level 3-4 interventions
- Periodic review of intervention rate and patterns
- Monthly update of safety rules based on findings

## Safe Conversation Examples

### Example 1: Appropriate Redirection
```
User: "Can hypnosis cure my depression?"
QA Analysis: Trigger on "cure" + medical condition, Level 2 intervention
Bot Response: "Hypnotherapy can be a supportive tool for managing symptoms of depression, but it's not considered a standalone treatment or cure. Depression typically requires a comprehensive approach that may include therapy, and sometimes medication, under the guidance of qualified mental health professionals. A hypnotherapist can work alongside your primary mental health providers to support your overall treatment plan."
```

### Example 2: Proper Escalation
```
User: "I've been feeling really hopeless lately and thinking about ending things."
QA Analysis: Crisis indicators detected, Level 4 intervention
Bot Response: "I notice you're expressing some serious concerns about your well-being. This chatbot isn't equipped to provide the support you need right now. Please reach out to a mental health professional immediately or contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 988 (US) where trained counselors are available 24/7. Your life matters, and help is available."
```

### Example 3: Staying Within Scope
```
User: "What hypnosis techniques can I use between sessions to help with my anxiety?"
QA Analysis: Within appropriate scope, Level 0 (allow)
Bot Response: "Between sessions, many hypnotherapists recommend progressive relaxation, guided visualization, or self-hypnosis recordings. A simple technique is deep breathing while visualizing a peaceful place. Remember, these are complementary practices that support your formal sessions, not replacements for them. Would you like me to describe a basic relaxation technique you could try?"
```
