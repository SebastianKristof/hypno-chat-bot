# Development Environment and Hosting Options

## Environment
Use poetry or venv to manage dependencies. Install:

pip install crewai fastapi uvicorn openai

## Editor
Use Cursor (Ai Editor based on VSCode). Install Python + YAML plugins.

## HOSTING OPTIONS
Once built, hereâ€™s how you can host it:

Hosting	Why Use It	How To Deploy
Render.com	Free tier, easy deploy from GitHub, auto HTTPS	Push your repo, connect to Render
Railway	Very simple for APIs, environment variables	Same as Render
Fly.io	Runs your API as a microservice	fly launch + fly deploy
VPS (DigitalOcean)	For more control	Use Docker + Uvicorn
Vercel	If you wrap your API in Next.js frontend	Deploy via GitHub

## Hosting & Platform Strategy (with RAG)
Letâ€™s weigh options based on your future goals:

Platform	Pros	Cons	Best For
Cursor (local)	Fast dev, GitHub native, supports everything you need	No hosting; you have to deploy it	Dev & testing
Firebase Studio	Built-in hosting, Firestore DB, easy web/app integration	Limited backend flexibility	Real-time DB, light apps
Render / Railway	One-click backend deploy, supports FastAPI, env vars	Slightly more setup than Firebase	Hosting your FastAPI chatbot
Supabase	Firebase-alternative, SQL DB, auth, storage	More backend-focused than Firebase	If you need auth or RAG from DB

My Suggestion:
Use Cursor for dev â†’ Deploy API via Render or Railway â†’ Host static site OR embed in client site â†’ Optionally use Firebase or Supabase if:
- You want auth (client login)
- You want booking or messaging history
- You want to store RAG knowledge base dynamically
