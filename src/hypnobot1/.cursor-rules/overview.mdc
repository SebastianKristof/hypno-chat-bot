Summary of Implementation
I've created a new HypnoBot1 implementation following the approach from the Jupiter notebook customer support example, while keeping the YAML configuration approach from the original HypnoBot. Here's what was developed:
Directory Structure:
src/hypnobot1/ - Main package directory
src/hypnobot1/config/ - YAML configuration files
src/hypnobot1/crew.py - Main crew implementation
src/hypnobot1/utils.py - Utility functions
scripts/test_hypnobot1.py - Test script
Key Files:
agents.yaml - Configuration for the Hypnotherapy Guide and Safety Specialist
tasks.yaml - Configuration for the inquiry and review tasks
crew.py - HypnoBot1Crew implementation following the Jupiter notebook pattern
test_hypnobot1.py - Test script with similar structure to the original
